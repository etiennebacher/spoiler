Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Etienne",
           family = "Bacher",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
           email = "etienne.bacher@protonmail.com")
Description: It can be useful to temporarily hide some text or other HTML elements 
    in 'Shiny' applications. Building on 'Spoiler-Alert.js', it is possible to select the
    elements to hide at startup, to partially reveal them by hovering them, and to 
    completely show them when clicking on them.
